# CS350

The project I selected for my portfolio submission is a smart thermostat prototype designed for dynamic temperature control. This thermostat uses a TI board, integrating a TMP006 temperature sensor via I2C to monitor room temperature, GPIO for managing the physical control signals, and UART for efficient server communication. The goal of this project was to implement an adaptable temperature control system that could be used in a variety of smart home environments. The solution aims to increase energy efficiency and provide a foundation for automated climate control based on real-time temperature feedback.

This project allowed me to combine hardware and software integration in a way that reflects real-world applications of embedded systems in smart home technology. I feel I excelled in creating a well-structured and clear codebase that integrates multiple communication protocols—GPIO, UART, and I2C—without sacrificing readability. This aspect of the project was particularly challenging due to the intricacies of embedded programming, but it gave me the chance to improve my skills in interfacing software with hardware components.

One area where I could improve is in implementing additional features for increased versatility, such as adding wireless communication capabilities to extend control remotely via a mobile app. This would allow the thermostat to be accessed and adjusted from anywhere, adding significant user value.

Throughout this project, I leveraged a variety of tools that I plan to keep in my toolkit moving forward. The TI Code Composer Studio was invaluable for coding and debugging, while the documentation for the TMP006 sensor and various online forums helped troubleshoot I2C-related challenges. Additionally, I found the TI board’s libraries for UART and GPIO configurations extremely useful. Expanding my understanding of these resources has strengthened my ability to tackle embedded systems challenges effectively.

Many of the skills I developed through this project, such as interfacing multiple communication protocols (UART, GPIO, I2C), reading and utilizing sensor documentation, and optimizing embedded software for performance, will be beneficial in future projects. Working on this thermostat system has reinforced my confidence in managing and deploying embedded code in a structured, readable format, which I can apply in future courses or professional work.

I focused on making the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by adopting clean coding practices and following a modular design. Each communication protocol function—temperature reading, data transmission, and control—was organized in separate functions or files to promote modularity. This approach not only made the code easier to understand but also prepared it for potential upgrades, like adding remote access capabilities or different sensor modules.
